Things I would like to add: 
 - Notifications for when an image is received and app is in background
 - An icon on list on of online player who have sent me an image
 - A set of multiplayer in a room
 - A multiple game channels
 - A text chat instead of image chat (maybe)(because of the image chat is a bit too much and take longer time in sending and receiving)
 - Saving history for player who wish to save it(maybe in real time DB or a log file with <key,value> as <SenderPlayerID, ReceiverPlayerID>)
 - Timeout for the image chat as it takes time to process sometimes (Who are to blame, sometimes internet is just not the correct way)
 - login with oAuth as well as email and password so saving history is easier

Bugs I encountered currently: 
 - The codes are not at all robust and I have not written a proper error handling system
 - The loading screen (of course, it is way to slow)
 - Image Size is but too large
 - Image fit to screen ratio is too much 
 - The Images are just not responsive enough
 - A many more (ðŸ˜‚ I can't list them all because I am low on time)
